What – Multiple Schedulers
kubectl get po -n kube-system

Why – To have a different algorithm in addition to default one for scheduling pods

How – Write a new scheduler, create its docker image and run it as pod.
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests
sudo chmod 777 kube-scheduler.yaml

    - --port=10308
    - --scheduler-name=my-scheduler
    - --secure-port=10330

# to check which application is running in this port number
 sudo netstat -netulp | grep 10259

kubectl logs my-scheduler -n kube-system

schedulerName: my-scheduler
